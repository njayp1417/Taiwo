Introduction to Health Communication
Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
Define health communication and explain its significance in health education and promotion
Identify the key components of the communication process
Describe at least three theoretical frameworks used in health communication
Analyse how mass media have influenced healthcare education historically
1.1 What is Health Communication?
Definition:  Health communication is the study and practice of communicating promotional health information, such as in public health campaigns, health education, and between doctor and patient. Health communications is a field that focuses on how information is shared to influence people's health behaviours, decisions, and outcomes. It involves using various strategies and channels, like media, messaging, and interpersonal communication, to promote health, prevent disease, and support healthcare services. The goal is to effectively engage audiences, improve health literacy, and drive positive change. Health communication is the study and practice of communicating promotional health information, such as in public health campaigns, health education, and between doctor and patient.
Key Concepts:
Interpersonal vs. mass communication in healthcare
One-way vs. two-way communication models
The role of health communication in disease prevention and health promotion
Health communication as a multidisciplinary field
Discussion Points:
Why is effective communication crucial in healthcare?
How does poor communication impact health outcomes?
Examples of health communication in daily life
1.2 Historical Evolution of Mass Media in Healthcare
Timeline Overview:
1900s-1940s: Print media and early public health posters (TB, hygiene campaigns)
1950s-1970s: Radio and television health programming emergence
1980s-1990s: Cable TV health channels, HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns
2000s-2010s: Internet, websites, and early social media health information
2010s-Present: Mobile health apps, social media influencers, telehealth
Case Examples:
Polio vaccination campaigns with March of Dimes
Anti-smoking "Truth" campaign evolution
COVID-19 information dissemination across platforms
1.3 The Communication Process Model
Components:
Source/Sender: Who creates the message (e.g., CDC, WHO, healthcare provider)
Message: The health information being communicated
Channel: Medium through which message travels (TV, social media, etc.)
Receiver/Audience: The target population
Feedback: Response from audience (behaviour change, engagement)
Noise: Barriers to effective communication (misinformation, language, literacy)
Application Exercise: Map a recent health campaign (e.g., flu vaccination) through this model
1.4 Theoretical Frameworks
A. Health Belief Model (HBM)
Core Concepts:
Perceived susceptibility: "Am I at risk?"
Perceived severity: "How serious is this condition?"
Perceived benefits: "Will this action help me?"
Perceived barriers: "What obstacles prevent action?"
Cues to action: Triggers that prompt behaviour
Self-efficacy: Confidence in ability to take action
Application: Designing messages that address each component
Example: Mammography screening campaigns targeting women 40+
B. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)
Core Concepts:
Reciprocal determinism: Person, behaviour, and environment interact
Observational learning: Learning by watching others
Behavioural capability: Knowledge and skills to perform behaviour
Outcome expectations: Anticipated results of behaviour
Self-efficacy: Confidence in performing behaviour
Application: Using role models and testimonials in campaigns
Example: Anti-smoking campaigns featuring former smokers
C. Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change)
Stages:
Precontemplation: Not ready to change
Contemplation: Thinking about change
Preparation: Getting ready to change
Action: Actively changing behaviour
Maintenance: Sustaining behaviour change
Application: Tailoring messages to audience's readiness stage
Example: Different messages for people who never exercised vs. those who exercise occasionally
