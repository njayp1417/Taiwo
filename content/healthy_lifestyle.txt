 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE EDUCATION
Physical, mental, social  and emotional well-being are interconnected aspects of overall health, encompassing your body's state (exercise, nutrition, sleep), your mind's ability to process, cope, and think (realizing potential, handling stress), and your capacity to manage feelings and build resilience (expressing emotions, bouncing back). Neglecting one area negatively impacts the others, forming a holistic concept where a balanced state across all three leads to greater life satisfaction and functioning. 

 Physical health refers to the well-being of the body and its ability to function optimally. It encompasses various aspects, including the absence of illness, the efficient functioning of bodily systems, and the ability to perform daily activities with ease and without undue fatigue. Key components of physical health include: Nutrition: Consuming a balanced diet that provides essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to support bodily functions and maintain energy levels. Exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity to improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance. Exercise also helps in weight management and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. Sleep: Getting adequate rest is crucial for the body's repair and recovery processes. Quality sleep supports cognitive function, emotional stability, and overall health. Hygiene: Maintaining cleanliness through regular bathing, dental care, and other personal hygiene practices to prevent infections and diseases. Preventive Care: Regular medical check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings help in early detection and prevention of health issues

Physical Well-being
Definition: The state of your body, supported by healthy habits.
Components: Regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, adequate sleep, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding harmful substances. 


Social health is your ability to build positive relationships, adapt to situations, and feel a sense of belonging, crucial for overall well-being, involving healthy interactions, community engagement, and navigating social environments, influenced by factors like economics and policy, requiring cooperation for things like clean environments and disease prevention. Good social health means connecting with others, managing stress in relationships, and participating in activities you enjoy. 
What are Three social health facts
To understand social health more clearly, it’s important to understand the facts surrounding it. Social health examples include hanging out with friends, being physically active, and balancing your social and personal time. Seeking to enhance those activities and moments by understanding how situations make you and those around you feel are social health examples. Here are some facts that illustrate the importance of having a healthy social life. They also help in assessing ways to improve or maintain it. 
Loneliness can impact health. Not seeking social relationships can lead to disrupted sleep patterns, elevated blood pressure and increased cortisol levels. Loneliness is also a risk factor for depression and suicide. Reaching out to friends, family, neighbors or coworkers are ways to prevent being lonely. Ask someone to grab a cup of coffee or go for a walk.
Increased longevity. Studies show that individuals with the lowest level of involvement in social relationships are more likely to die sooner than those with greater involvement. Social isolation increases a person’s risk of premature death by 29%. Like we mentioned earlier, invite those around you to hang out. As you build your relationship, you’ll both reap the health benefits.
Better cognitive health. It’s no surprise that having healthy social engagement can maintain cognitive function. Strong relationships in older adults lead to a lower risk of dementia and mental decline, while social isolation is associated with a 50% increase in dementia
What are social health strengths and weaknesses examples
Strengths:
You balance your alone and social time. A healthy ratio between alone and social time varies from person to person. Extroverts may need more social interaction, while introverts aim for more solitude. Having the right balance means you’re socially healthy.
You’re assertive but not aggressive. Letting others know how you feel, while not having to apologize or feel resentful for stating your needs, is important to being socially healthy. This strength needs effective communication skills.
You can be yourself. Being comfortable in your own skin and having a sense of belonging are crucial in being socially healthy.
You participate in the community. Part of being socially active away from those in your family or household is being involved in your community. Whether you volunteer at your church or a nonprofit, play sports at the local YMCA, or help at your kid’s school, those are signs of a healthy social life.
You have fun. One of the main reasons to focus on your social health is to have fun. Life can get busy and stressful, so when you’re interacting with friends and those in your community, be sure to enjoy it.
Weaknesses:
Poor communication skills. How can you effectively socialize with others when you lack communication skills? Maintain eye contact, use active listening and keep your body language in mind when conversing with others.
Low self-esteem. This can be caused by past experiences, mental illnesses and other factors.
You wait for others to make plans. Making the first move in planning to hang out with friends and casual contacts can help your social health. Others may not realize you want to meet for coffee, so reach out first.
Social media. This one is two-fold. Social media is known to impact social health positively and negatively. Users can stay in touch with others to maintain and strengthen relationships while also harming connections from superficial posts and communication habits.
Keep commitments. Sometimes it may be easier to cancel plans and just stay home, but that can harm your relationship and future opportunities to go out. If you can’t make the scheduled hangout, ask to reschedule.
What causes poor social health?
Sometimes it can be difficult to understand what causes poor social health. Whether it’s things you can control or how others make you feel, there are many factors affecting social health. Here are a few examples that cause poor social health: 
Bad influences. At first, you may think a friend or friend group has your best interests in mind and brings out the best in you. But over time, that thought may change with how they treat you. Bad friends may not support you, be trusted with secrets or be counted on when you need them. It’s important to have people around you who will be there in a time of need, which will help your social health.
Toxic relationships. Being around a person who is controlling, emotionally unstable or jealous can cause you physical and mental harm.
People change. You may have had common interests with a friend years ago, but now you both seem to be on different paths. If that’s the case, it may be best to distance yourself even further, especially if their interests are a bad influence on you.
Mental Well-being
Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community.  The WHO states that mental health is “more than the absence of mental disorders.” Peak mental health is about managing active conditions and maintaining wellness and happiness. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood and aging
 Mental well-being refers to a positive state of emotional, psychological, and social health, characterized by a sense of contentment, resilience, and the ability to effectively cope with life's challenges. It encompasses positive emotions, a sense of purpose, and the capacity to engage in fulfilling relationships and activities.    Mental well-being is a key component of overall quality of life (QoL), as positive mental health contributes significantly to an individual's perception of their life's value and fulfillment
What are mental disorders
Mental disorders are serious conditions that can affect your thinking, mood, and behavior. They may be occasional or long-lasting. They can affect your ability to relate to others and function each day. Mental disorders are common; many individuals will be diagnosed with one at some time in their life. But there are treatments. People with mental disorders can get better, and many of them recover completely.

Why is mental health important
Mental health is important because it can help you to:
Cope with the stresses of life
Be physically healthy
Have good relationships
Make meaningful contributions to your community
Work productively
Realize your full potential
Your mental health is also important because it can affect your physical health. For example, mental disorders can raise your risk for physical health problems such as stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.
What can affect my mental health
There are many different factors that can affect your mental health, including:
Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
Family history of mental health problems
Your lifestyle, such as diet, physical activity, and substance use

Can my mental health change over time
Over time, your mental health can change. For example, you may be dealing with a difficult situation, such as trying to manage a chronic illness, taking care of an ill relative, or facing money problems. The situation may wear you out and overwhelm your ability to cope with it. This can worsen your mental health. On the other hand, getting therapy may improve your mental health.
What are the signs that I might have a mental health problem?
When it comes to your emotions, it can be hard to know what is normal and what is not. There are warning signs that you may have a mental health problem, including:
A change in your eating or sleeping habits
Withdrawing from the people and activities you enjoy
Having low or no energy
Feeling numb or like nothing matters
Having unexplained aches and pains
Feeling helpless or hopeless
Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual
Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, angry, upset, worried, or scared
Having severe mood swings that cause problems in your relationships
Having thoughts and memories that you can't get out of your head
Hearing voices or believing things that are not true
Thinking of harming yourself or others
Not being able to perform daily tasks like taking care of your kids or getting to work or school


Emotional Well-being
Definition: Your ability to understand, express, and manage your feelings and behaviors.
Components: Developing a positive mindset, bouncing back from setbacks (resilience), keeping problems in perspective, and knowing your values. 
The Interconnection (Holistic View)
Mind-Body Link: Mental distress (like anxiety or depression) can manifest as physical symptoms (fatigue, headaches).
Holistic Health: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not just the absence of disease, emphasizing this interconnectedness.
Impact: Achieving balance across these areas enhances work performance, relationships, and overall quality of life, while neglect in one area, like sleep, affects the others.
